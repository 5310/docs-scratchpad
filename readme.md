# Scratchpad for Docs

This is an add-on for Google Docs that adds a simple scratchpad that can be used to write anything, outlines, rough notes, phrasing variations, your call.

Of course, Google App Script add-on's publication process is pathetically locked down and restrictive to say the least, so this addon doesn't exist on the marketplace. I can't even have it available as a personal add-on myself, I have to duplicate a file with the scripts added to start.

Feel free to create a blank file and copy over the script yourself. Follow the quickstart guide and instead of copying the sample add-on, paste in these sources instead. (The assets folder is not required, only the `Code.gs` and `Sidebar.html` files.)
